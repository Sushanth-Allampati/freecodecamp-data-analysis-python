# freeCodeCamp â€“ Data Analysis with Python Certification Projects

This repository contains the five projects I completed for the **Data Analysis with Python** certification from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/).

Each project applies core data analysis techniques using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**. The projects involve real datasets and focus on data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and basic statistical analysis.

## Projects
- Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
- Demographic Data Analyzer
- Medical Data Visualizer
- Page View Time Series Visualizer
- Sea Level Predictor

These projects demonstrate my ability to work with structured data, extract insights, and communicate findings effectively through visualizations.
